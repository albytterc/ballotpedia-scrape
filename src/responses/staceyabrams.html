<p>Ballotpedia provides race ratings from three outlets: <i>The Cook Political Report</i>, <i>Inside Elections</i>, and <i>Sabato's Crystal Ball</i>. Each race rating indicates if one party is perceived to have an advantage in the race and, if so, the degree of advantage:
</p>
<ul><li><i><b>Safe</b></i> and <i><b>Solid</b></i> ratings indicate that one party has a clear edge and the race is not competitive.</li>
<li><i><b>Likely</b></i> ratings indicate that one party has a clear edge, but an upset is possible.</li>

<li><i><b>Toss-up</b></i> ratings indicate that neither party has an advantage.</li></ul>
<p>Race ratings are informed by a number of factors, including polling, candidate quality, and election result history in the race's district or state.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup>

<p><b>Economic Mobility</b>
</p><p>I have a vision for Georgia where prosperity is measured by more than how well business is doing. We need to judge our economy by how many of our families can thrive. Can they afford to start a small business, send a child to camp, take a vacation and not worry about a blown tire or a new prescription? For too many Georgians, the answer is no.  
</p><p>As Governor, I will steer Georgia to becoming a state where everyone can move up and move forward, to succeed—not just survive.
</p><p>Georgia families deserve a leader who will invest in every person and who has the economic vision and the experience to increase prosperity, lift families from poverty, invest in small businesses and rural development, reduce income inequality and ensure a fair and inclusive economy for all Georgians. 
</p><p>I am an entrepreneur who has helped small businesses in Georgia access capital to create and retain thousands of jobs. As a nonprofit leader, I have employed hundreds of Georgians across the state. During my tenure as Georgia House Minority Leader, I developed and promoted policy solutions to serve our families, and I defeated a Republican tax hike that would have been the single largest tax increase in Georgia history. 
</p><p>I have the experience to build a fair, thriving economy where every hardworking family has the chance to succeed and thrive. My Georgia Economic Mobility Plan will grow the economy for Georgians and focus on jobs and wages, rural revitalization, small business investment and economic justice.
</p><p><b>Economic Justice</b>
</p><p>Our state’s economy has left too many people behind, and the next governor must ensure that all working Georgians enjoy a decent standard of living. Doing so is both a moral necessity and a fundamental building block of a strong economy. To guarantee that more Georgians can take care of themselves and their families, we must stop waiting for change and create it ourselves.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Georgia Earned Income Tax Credit:</b> Create a refundable tax credit that will let more than 1 million working families keep an average of $280 more of their hard-earned wages, with the greatest impact in rural counties.</li>
<li><b>Cradle to Career Savings Program:</b> Invest in every child born in Georgia with a savings account they can use for higher education, housing, or starting a business, which invests money locally and builds opportunity for Georgia families.</li>
<li><b>Increase Disability Protections:</b> Advance economic security for disabled Georgians by ending the practice of subminimum wages and defend disabled Georgians by enforcing fair wage payments.</li>
<li><b>Close the Skills Gap:</b> Partner with educators, employers and nonprofit organizations to identify and promote successful adult literacy initiatives and to develop employability skills programs at every level of our educational system.</li></ul>
<p><b>Jobs and Wages</b>
</p><p>The foundation of a thriving economy is the ability of every Georgian to find a good job and earn a decent living, take care of their families and survive a catastrophic event knowing that their government is a partner in – not an obstacle to – recovery.
</p>
<ul><li><b>End Wage Theft and Misclassification:</b> Protect Georgia workers from employers who refuse to meet their obligations, costing Georgia families $300 million. We will hold employers accountable for exploiting and underpaying their workers. We will also crack down on employers who wrongly classify employees as independent contractors to avoid paying employer taxes and a fair wage.</li>
<li><b>Fairly Invest in Infrastructure:</b> Georgia will receive billions in federal funds for infrastructure, but right now, the powerful will be first in line for contracts, jobs and projects in their communities. My administration will create a transparent, equitable distribution of infrastructure funds across the state, in which citizens can track how and where funds are spent – and who is making the decisions about where progress is made.</li>
<li><b>Increase Apprenticeships:</b> Work with technical colleges, small businesses and unions to generate more than 20,000 additional apprenticeships in fields ranging from building trades and construction to coding and healthcare.</li>
<li><b>Protect Workers:</b> Secure legislative and regulatory changes such as paid sick leave, expansion of unemployment insurance and the repeal of preemption laws that prevent local communities from taking actions to support workers.</li>
<li><b>Buy Georgia Products:</b> Encourage state agencies, projects and contractors to buy more Georgia products and employ more Georgia workers in order to support our local economy.</li></ul>
<p><b>Rural Revitalization</b>
</p><p>Georgians in all 159 counties—not just metropolitan areas— deserve access to high wage job opportunities, excellent schools and world-class health care.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Invest Equitably in Broadband and Affordable Access:</b>  The federal government is deploying millions in broadband infrastructure for Georgia’s rural areas, but every county should have a chance to participate. My administration will monitor how funds are targeted to make sure all rural counties have a fair shot at receiving investment. We will also work with the private sector and local communities to guarantee high-speed Internet access is affordable to many of the hundreds of thousands of households that are currently unserved.</li>
<li><b>Comprehensive Rural Education Funding Formula:</b> Expand educational opportunities for children in rural counties by applying a funding formula that recognizes the challenges faced by rural communities, attracting talented teachers with competitive pay, creating STEAM after-school programs, funding transportation and resources and working with local agencies and nonprofits to provide more quality childcare options in underserved areas.</li>
<li><b>Save Rural Hospitals and Create Thousands of Jobs:</b> Expand Medicaid to support rural hospitals, attract medical professionals to underserved communities and increase the number of medical apprenticeships in rural areas. Medicaid expansion will create more than 60,000 new jobs in rural Georgia, including construction, retail, healthcare and services while offering access to coverage for more than 500,000 additional Georgians. Local counties will also save millions on uncompensated care – the cost of Georgians who can’t pay their bills – money that can go into vital community needs.</li></ul>
<p><b>Small Business Investment</b>
</p><p>Small businesses are the heart of our state’s economy and a crucial driver of economic mobility both for business owners and for workers. Georgia has more than 1.1 million small businesses, which account for 99.6% of all Georgia businesses.  Approximately 1.7 million Georgians are employed by small businesses, and that is nearly 43% of Georgia’s employees. As a small business owner and entrepreneur, we need a governor who understands the barriers to small business success and is willing to invest in scaling our economy starting here.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Small Business Capital Growth Fund:</b> Invest $10 million in small business financing programs that do not duplicate existing, hard-to-use programs and help grow customers and commerce. Develop partnerships with private lenders and CDFIs to multiply investments, and support technical assistance and training programs to help business owners start, grow and scale their companies. Incentivize greater private sector financial support by directing the Department of Banking and Finance to evaluate banks’ activities in terms of outreach, financial investment, and participation in technical assistance programs.</li>
<li><b>Entrepreneurship Learner’s Permit:</b> Establish incubation program through the Georgia Department of Economic Development to assist individuals seeking to form new businesses in the state. This program would support first-time entrepreneurs by providing waivers for filing, permitting or licensing fees associated with the formation of new businesses and provide education and training for prospective permit holders and current permit holders.</li>
<li><b>Georgia Commercial Investment Program:</b> Use Georgia’s purchasing power to support small businesses, including those owned by women, people of color, veterans, the disabled and those in rural areas, by directing the Department of Administrative Services to establish and monitor targets for purchasing by all state agencies.</li></ul>
<p><b>Transportation</b>
</p><p>Georgia must continue to invest in a range of transportation services across the state. Improving transportation is a critical component to strengthen our state’s economy. It is a key driver of social and economic mobility for business owners, workers and families.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Enhance Capacity for Growth in Transportation:</b> Invest in transit through bonding capacity; grant general fund incentives where appropriate; and include transit as a permitted use of motor fuel taxes, without sacrificing our current efforts on roads, bridges and economic development projects.</li>
<li><b>Expand transportation options:</b> Promote economic development and connect more people to job opportunities by investing in long-distance passenger rail lines. Partner with local communities to expand and coordinate commuter rail and bus networks, particularly in rural transit deserts.</li>
<li><b>Build Infrastructure:</b> Invest in transportation infrastructure that workers and businesses need to succeed throughout Georgia, especially in areas that are currently underserved.</li>
<li><b>Increase Accessible Transportation Options:</b> Champion more reliable, efficient non-emergency transportation to ensure seniors, disabled people and others can get to medical appointments, school and work. Promote local efforts to launch volunteer driver programs.</li></ul>
<p><br />
<b>Educational Mobility</b>
</p><p>As Georgia’s next governor, I will prioritize access to childcare and education for all children – no matter who they are or where they live. A strong early start and fully funded public education are fundamental to building a state where every family has the freedom and opportunity to thrive.
</p><p>Children in Georgia currently lag behind on a variety of metrics, including access to services and graduation rates. Our children deserve support from cradle to career, which begins with a high-quality education that gives them opportunities to reach their dreams. Georgia has the resources to expand access to childcare and pre-k, fully fund education and expand HOPE grants, but those currently in power refuse to do the right thing. 
</p><p>We are ready to imagine more for our children than simply an adequate education and we are ready to elect leaders committed to making excellence a reality.
</p><p><b>Birth to 4 – Childcare and Pre-K</b>
</p><p>Our commitment to education should begin with a focus on birth to three, the early stages of childcare and pre-kindergarten. Providing high-quality, affordable child care to all families is one of the most important investments we can make to enable parents to fulfill their potential and to prepare all children to be skilled, well-rounded and civic-minded citizens in the future. According to the Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students, the average annual cost of infant care in Georgia is $7,644, an amount that leaves many parents feeling as if affordable child care is out of reach. Without affordable child care, many parents will not be able to enter or remain in the workforce. Likewise, universal pre-k aids children with the skills and tools they need to begin school ready to learn, acclimate and succeed.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Bold Start Scholarship Program:</b> Invest in statewide access to childcare, especially in low-income communities to ensure that all families can access quality and affordable child care. A Bold Start Scholarship Program will pay all child care costs that exceed 10 percent of a family’s income.</li>
<li><b>Increase Supply of High-quality Child Care:</b> Decrease staff shortages by expanding tax credits for child care workers, partnering with financial institutions and technical assistance organizations to support new child care businesses and targeting underserved rural areas and nontraditional hours by working with community-based agencies and local nonprofits. Address childcare deserts by pulling down all available federal funds to fully fund child care.</li>
<li><b>Support Families with Increased Paid Parental Leave:</b> Strengthening families starts with early investment. Currently, Georgia’s state employees are eligible for only up to three weeks (120 hours) of paid parental leave per year after the birth or adoption of a child. Increased paid time off will help improve healthy development and maternal health, while enhancing economic security.</li>
<li><b>Universal Georgia Pre-K:</b> Fully fund Georgia Pre-K, a highly sought after and effective program, to make it truly universal and accessible to all families that want to participate.</li></ul>
<p><b>K-12 Public Education</b>
</p><p>Education is one of the strongest predictors of economic success – both for individuals and for the state’s economy. Georgia ranks 30th in the nation for preschool and K-12 education. Yet, the current governor has failed to lead on education before and during the pandemic. He gutted education funding early in his tenure and cut nearly one billion dollars from education last year. This year, his current proposal restored little more than half of what he cut and was funded by federal investment. This one-time infusion of federal funds leaves a massive hole in the state’s education funding promise to its children. Georgia must reverse the impact of this negligence by investing in the needs of the whole child from cradle to career – and our investment must extend beyond the walls of a classroom to meet the needs of the whole child.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Update and Fully Fund Georgia’s Quality Basic Education Formula:</b> The QBE formula has not been revised to meet the changing needs of students, families and communities. Georgia must adopt a comprehensive education funding formula that not only pays our teachers well but must address new realities: directly addresses the correlation between poverty and poor educational outcomes, invests in student transportation to ensure safety, provides resources for crucial positions like nurses and substitute teachers and invests in technology to enable our children to compete in the 21st Century.</li>
<li><b>Establish Permanent Teacher Pay Increases:</b> While our current governor issues incremental and inadequate raises to teachers at public events, he has failed to put in place a sustainable funding structure to attract talented educators to Georgia. <u>1 in 4 teachers</u> are considering leaving their profession because of new and longtime challenges. Our teachers, paraprofessionals and staff deserve competitive wages and investment, not further threats to resources in an effort to divide Georgians for political gain. Schools must have enough funding to promote excellent working conditions for teachers and faculty while paying teachers for the essential work they do to educate Georgia’s children.</li>
<li><b>Establish the Georgia Educator Pipeline Project:</b> Invest in leadership development for our schools’ administrators and facilitate the creation of a robust pipeline of teachers who are ready to work in every part of the state. We will build these pipelines in partnership with our state’s colleges offering degrees in education and provide incentives like student loan repayment programs for those willing to educate children in underserved areas. I will expand resources for the Governor’s School Leadership Academy to enhance its ability to provide a comprehensive and equitable system of support and build capacity for Georgia educators.</li>
<li><b>End Public School Dollar Diversion Programs:</b> Public dollars should go to public schools. I will oppose private school tax credits and vouchers.</li>
<li><b>Increase Presence of Mental Health Professionals:</b> Provide student and educator mental health funding to add school counselors for all students as well as access to telemedicine and other innovative programming for mental health supports. The American School Counselor Association recommends a minimum of one counselor per 250 students. Georgia’s ratio is currently 1 counselor per 432 students, a ratio far too high.</li>
<li><b>Defend Complete and Honest Education:</b> Reject attempts to teach children misinformation in the public school system. Our children deserve a complete and honest education without threats to school funding. Some topics like slavery, segregation or the Trail of Tears are difficult, but our children must be given age-appropriate lessons and context. Parents and teachers should take part in these conversations; however, no school should face sanctions for teaching an accurate history of this nation or for preparing our children for the diverse world in which they live. As governor, I will oppose policies that drive a wedge between educators and families, and I will support programs that build trust and increase collaboration between those who are most engaged in our children’s success.</li>
<li><b>Eliminate Harmful Waivers:</b> As of 2015, school systems can be granted “waivers” from state education laws, rules and guidelines, effectively giving local school districts veto power over the Georgia General Assembly’s policies on public education. These waivers allow districts to disregard state laws pertaining to class size maximums, health and P.E., teacher certification requirements and more, which negatively impacts the quality of public education in Georgia. As governor, I will re-examine the waiver policy to eliminate harmful waivers and ensure that any permitted waivers provide local flexibility without compromising the quality public education Georgia’s children deserve.</li>
<li><b>Support Our Children:</b> Oppose any legislation that will have the effect of harming or increasing the likelihood of harm to students. For example, according to the CDC, 35% of transgender students attempt suicide by the time they reach high school. Transgender and nonbinary youth who have access to a gender-affirming space at school – like a supportive sports team – are 25% less likely to attempt suicide over the course of a year.</li>
<li><b>Increase Funding and Supports for Disadvantaged and Marginalized Students:</b> Provide solutions that meet individual needs, including supports for ESL learners, students of color, disabled children and low-income students.</li></ul>
<p><b>Post-Secondary and Higher Education</b>
</p><p>In Georgia, higher education investment must expand to create pathways to every level of post-secondary education, and we must provide access to aid for all students. Georgia must do more to increase educational opportunities beyond high school and help students graduate from any public program of their choice without debt.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Fully Fund the College Need-Based Aid Program:</b> Georgia is one of two states with no funding for need-based aid, despite having an existing mechanism that the current governor has refused to fund. This funding will ensure that our students – regardless of the educational path they choose or the financial challenges they face – will have the opportunity to pursue their dreams and graduate without debt.</li>
<li><b>Restore Tuition-Free Technical College:</b> Georgia’s technical colleges play a vital role for many students by emphasizing career-focused, hands-on training in trades and technical skills. As governor, I will work to make technical college accessible to more Georgians, by restoring tuition-free technical certificates and diplomas for students with a 2.0 GPA. Additionally, I will work with the Technical College System of Georgia to ensure funding aligns with strategic priorities for the years ahead and is available for technical colleges to attract students.</li>
<li><b>Restore Academic Tenure:</b> Recent actions by the Georgia Board of Regents to eliminate academic tenure have severely undermined our public universities. As governor, I will restore protections for the talented and dedicated faculty of Georgia’s colleges and universities by restoring tenure. Academic tenure builds a system of strong job protections that is essential to Georgia’s ability to compete for talent and produce innovation.</li>
<li><b>Eliminate Barriers to Higher Education:</b> I will support programs that increase higher education opportunities for Georgians experiencing barriers to access, including foster youth, students of color, disadvantaged youth, first-generation college students, disabled students, DREAMers, adult learners, veterans and military families.</li>
<li><b>Invest in Georgia’s HBCUs and HSIs:</b> My administration will invest in our Historically Black Colleges and Universities, both public and independent, in support of their service to Georgia students. Through our reforms to HOPE, more students at our public HBCUs will have the economic ability to complete their education. Likewise, as our Latino population grows, we will support our Hispanic Serving Institutions. We will explore how to partner with independent colleges and universities for summer bridge programs that aid students, particularly first-generation college students, in transitioning from high school to college.</li>
<li><b>Protect Our Students:</b> I will promote campus environments that are safe, secure and responsive. We will repeal campus carry, provide greater training for campus police and encourage productive dialogue between law enforcement and our students to address their safety concerns. We will support survivors of sexual assault by working to identify gaps in protections, reporting processes and services. We will defend the rights of DREAMers as they pursue their educational goals.</li></ul>
<p><br />
<b>Social Mobility</b>
</p><p>From personal experience, I understand that where we begin should not determine where we finish. Growing up with five siblings whose parents worked hard and still struggled to pay their bills, secure the best education for their six children and achieve the American Dream. They taught us that the keys to success are faith, family, service, education and responsibility. But they also showed my siblings and I that we are responsible for making the world fairer, wherever and whenever we can.
</p><p>In today’s Georgia, a lot of folks are doing fine, some are doing extremely well and others have exactly what they want. We should celebrate success in Georgia, but we can never act as though opportunity is a privilege. In the United States, opportunity is the cornerstone of how we think about the future: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
</p><p>As governor, I will be committed to tackling the barriers that prevent too many Georgians from dreaming big and moving forward. Zip code, background or access to power should not decide the future for you or your family. 
</p><p>We have to work for what we want, and sometimes, the fight is harder than it should be. But the game should never be rigged. That’s why we elect leaders – not to pick winners and losers but to be fair referees who call out the bad actors and do their best to level the playing field. 
</p><p>I have been a tax attorney, a small business owner, a nonprofit leader and a best-selling author. We will all stumble and sometimes fall, but success should never be out of reach. What my parents instilled in me is what I want for all of Georgia: a partner in government who can help where it should and get out of the way whenever it can. 
</p><p>Social mobility is how we describe that pursuit: affordable housing, safe communities, civil justice, effective transportation, the ability to start a life here and the choice to age in place. In Georgia, though, this partnership with the people will become an escalator – not an anchor.
</p><p><b>Safe and Affordable Housing</b>
</p><p>Safe and affordable housing is essential to every Georgian’s well-being and opportunity to thrive. A well-maintained and safe home supports physical and mental health, leads to higher educational achievement and employment potential, decreases criminal justice system involvement and increases overall community wealth and well-being. This is true whether we live in Georgia’s big cities, small towns or rural communities. As governor, I am ready to implement important solutions to Georgia’s housing challenges.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Expand Affordable Housing:</b> Provide direct financial assistance to local communities, including a state affordable housing fund to allow each community to access critical resources to meet local challenges. This will include properly deploying the millions in unspent rental assistance disbursed to Georgia.</li>
<li><b>Reducing Housing Challenges:</b> Address the diverse range of housing needs for those with disabilities, military families and veterans, and those reentering our communities. Voucher programs, emergency assistance, and other aid and protections can help support these Georgians.</li>
<li><b>Protect Georgia Renters and Good Landlords:</b> Tackle discrimination, predatory business practices, and abusive eviction filings and reform eviction courts to prevent excessive fees and unsafe living conditions. Renting families and law-abiding, responsible landlords deserve common-sense legal reforms that will make our courts work better for families and property owners.</li>
<li><b>Improve Housing Safety:</b> Veto and support the repeal of laws that preempt local communities from providing safe, affordable housing for their residents. Invest in protective measures, such as lighting, architectural design improvements and materials.</li>
<li><b>Shelter and Safety:</b> Support victims of family violence and sexual assault by ensuring that service providers in every part of the state can offer assistance and shelter. In 2020, over 5,600 victims and their children were provided nearly 120,000 nights of refuge in Georgia domestic violence shelters, and over 15,700 victims were turned away due to lack of space. The need is great, and the service gap must be closed.</li>
<li><b>Homeless Service Investment:</b> Increase quantity and access to provide more shelter beds, supportive housing and transition support to address temporary homelessness and end the long-term cycles of homelessness that plague our communities.</li></ul>
<p><b>Aging and Independence</b>
</p><p>Georgia’s senior citizens are a tremendous asset to our state. Whether by virtue of their life experience in our state’s diverse workforce or the volunteer leadership they provide for our community organizations, seniors are integral to building thriving communities in every region of Georgia.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Strengthen Aging and Disability Resource Centers:</b> Help more seniors age in place by increasing support to the Aging and Disability Resource Centers, which offer critical connections between seniors and services. Devote resources to the Community Care Services program and Home and Community Based Service program to cut wait times and waitlists for services such as home health aides, delivered meals and personal care needs.</li>
<li><b>Improve Transportation Options for Seniors:</b> Increase access to and quantity of reliable, efficient non- emergency medical transportation to ensure seniors and others can get to their medical appointments. Additionally, we will promote local efforts to launch volunteer driver programs.</li>
<li><b>Expand Medicaid:</b> We will expand Medicaid to help early seniors who have not reached Medicare-age, namely, seniors who have lost their jobs or work for employers that do not offer health coverage. Medicaid expansion will also infuse more funds into the system to meet the assisted living needs of more seniors.</li>
<li><b>Re-energize the Older Adults Cabinet:</b> Georgia’s Older Adults Cabinet has provided cross-sector collaboration among state agencies, providers and nonprofits to address the challenges facing seniors, and we are eager to reinstate this important work. Unfortunately, under Georgia’s current governor, this vital input has been ignored and the cabinet has gone dormant.</li></ul>
<p><b>Gun Safety</b>
</p><p>Georgians deserve a thoughtful approach to how we keep our communities safe that combines respect for gun ownership and accountability for gun safety. In 2019, Georgia ranked 14th in the nation for gun deaths and Georgia outranked any other state for exporting guns that were used in crimes. Georgians deserve a thoughtful approach to how we keep our communities safe that combines respect for gun ownership and accountability for gun safety.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Stop or Repeal Criminal Carry:</b> The current governor seeks to pass legislation that will make it easier for criminals to carry concealed weapons without a permit. Dubbed “permitless carry” by some, this legislation would have allowed 5,300 people who were rejected in 2020 to carry hidden weapons in 2022. Kemp’s plan will arm these individuals and send them on the street, into our churches, into our schools. It also creates a loophole for domestic abusers and the mentally ill to avoid detection and secure lethal weapons.</li>
<li><b>Repeal Campus Carry, ‘Guns Everywhere’, and Gun Return Laws:</b> These anti-safety laws have been opposed by Georgia university administrators, educators, pastors and parishioners, and a majority of Georgians. I would also reform the “Gun Return” law, described as “the most egregious gun law in Georgia” and opposed by law enforcement because it requires that guns used to commit crime be put back onto the street.</li>
<li><b>Close the Domestic Violence Loophole:</b> We must pass legislation to stop perpetrators of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking from accessing guns, which may include prohibiting possession and requiring the surrender of firearms or ammunition by domestic abusers. Laws in other states to address this “relinquishment gap” have lowered firearm related intimate partner homicides by 14%.</li>
<li><b>Protect People Experiencing Mental Illness and Their Families:</b> Georgia must follow other states with legislation to allow families to petition for extreme risk protection orders. When a loved one has mental health challenges that put them at risk of endangering themselves or others, families and law enforcement should have a path to petition a court to temporarily restrict firearms access.</li></ul>
<p><b>Immigration</b>
</p><p>Every person should be treated with basic human dignity and respect, including members of the immigrant community who are part of the fabric of our state. Our nation must pursue fair, just, and comprehensive immigration reform that balances the conversation of safety with the need to create a pathway to citizenship for individuals who are in this country. Effective immigration policy also recognizes America’s role in the world as a place of refuge and asylum for those who are fleeing persecution and harm.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Oppose Separation of Children:</b> I strongly oppose the cruel and immoral practice of separating migrant children from their parents. Regardless of political party, all of us must stand up and speak up for the voiceless – or risk inflicting irreparable damage on these families and to our nation.</li>
<li><b>Improve Community Relations with Immigrant Communities:</b> As governor, I will work with law enforcement to improve communications and engagement with immigrant communities. Georgia must reject behavior that forces people into the shadows and prevents any resident from reporting crimes, either as a victim or a witness. That system undermines the ability of law enforcement to do their job and harms us all.</li>
<li><b>Grant Academic Access to DREAMers:</b> I will defend the rights of DREAMers as they pursue their educational goals. My plan for higher education helps put every Georgian on a pathway to debt-free post-secondary education. Many people do not realize that the governor has the ability to appoint the Board of Regents, which oversees our post-secondary system. As governor, I will make sure immigrants, women, people of color, and people with disabilities serve on the Board of Regents. We must also provide pathways for DACA recipients to access higher education in Georgia.</li></ul>
<p><b>LGBTQ+ Rights</b>
</p><p>Throughout my career in public service, I have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to supporting equality for LGBTQ+ Georgians. An effective government must protect civil rights and fight discrimination. From supporting marriage equality and comprehensive workplace protections to opposing any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, I am ready to build a stronger, brighter state where the gates of opportunity are open to every Georgian.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Enhance and Embrace Civil and Human Rights:</b>  Adopt protections in housing, employment and public accommodations for all Georgians, including those who fear discrimination.</li>
<li><b>Respect Georgia’s Families:</b> Bolster the rights of LGBTQ+ parents who seek to grow their families but do not yet have necessary legal protections.</li>
<li><b>Nurture and Protect LGBTQ+ children:</b> Cultivate school programs that proactively support LGBTQ+ kids and work to halt bullying, harassment and discrimination.</li>
<li><b>Fair and Diverse Economy for all Georgians:</b> Reform the Georgia Commission on Equal Opportunity into the Georgia Commission on Human Rights. This restructured commission will have the ability to set clear pathways for harassment complaints, be a referral point for Georgia workers, and oversee mediation or investigations into harassment for those workers who do not fall under federal purview.</li></ul>
<p><b>Disability Rights</b>
</p><p>An effective government must protect civil rights and fight discrimination based on disability. Though it has been more than thirty years since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, disabled people are still fighting for inclusion, equal opportunity and economic stability. As governor, I will work in partnership with the disability community in Georgia to fulfill the promises of the ADA: equal opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Increase Disability Protections:</b> Advance economic security for disabled Georgians by ending the practice of subminimum wages and defend disabled Georgians by enforcing fair wage payments.</li>
<li><b>Affordable and Accessible Housing:</b> Create incentives to increase the supply of affordable and accessible housing that can meet the needs of disabled Georgians and hold landlords accountable for discriminatory practices.</li>
<li><b>Support People Coping with Long Covid:</b> Champion protections for people with Long Covid to ensure that treatment is accessible and affordable and that federal anti-discrimination laws are enforced in cases when Long Covid becomes a disability.</li>
<li><b>Expand Medicaid:</b> Increase access to a full range of medical and mental healthcare for Georgians, including disabled people.</li></ul>
<p><br />
<b>Health Care</b>
</p><p>All Georgians deserve access to quality, affordable healthcare services to support their physical and mental well-being and to have financial security. During the pandemic, more than 30,000 Georgians have died from Covid complications, and thousands more have been temporarily or permanently disabled. The mental health impact of Covid and the stress of the pandemic continue to affect nearly every community. The share of Georgia adults who reported increased anxiety or depression spiked by 30% in 2021, yet we have 143 mental health care providers for every 100,000 people in Georgia. Our rural health care delivery system, already fragile due to Georgia’s failure to expand Medicaid, has been stretched even further by the Covid pandemic, and our rural communities are reeling. In Hancock County, <u>one out of every 100 people</u> has died from Covid complications.
</p><p>While Covid has ravaged our state, other health care issues have continued. Georgia leads much of the nation in the number of uninsured, a terrible ranking with real consequences. Our state’s children are also in jeopardy: About four-in-ten of our counties have NO general pediatricians. Additionally, about half of our counties have no Ob/Gyns and about half have no psychiatrists. The geographic, racial and ethnic disparities that Georgians experience every day in our state are stark, documented and unacceptable. Georgia has been called the most <u>dangerous state</u> for pregnant women because of our high maternal mortality rates, particularly for Black mothers. 
</p><p>The burden of chronic disease falls unevenly in our state: Black people are <u>dying from complications from diabetes </u>at more than twice the rate of white people. These disparities stem from inequities in health coverage and access to care, but also from poverty and lack of access to nutritious foods, safe and stable housing and reliable transportation. Georgia’s continued inaction on Medicaid expansion is a catastrophe for our families, our communities, our under-resourced public health and our overworked hospital systems.  
</p><p>As governor, I will work every day to directly address our state’s health outcomes, strengthen our state’s health care delivery system and increase access to meaningful health coverage for all Georgians.
</p><p><b>Expand Medicaid</b>
</p><p>Georgia is one of only <u>12 states</u> that has refused to expand Medicaid. More than <u>1.5 million</u> Georgians lack health insurance coverage and our uninsured rate is the <u>second-highest</u> in the nation. When we expand Medicaid, more than <u>500,000</u> additional Georgians will have access and be able to see a health care provider without fear of medical debt, more than <u>60,000</u> new jobs will be generated in our local economies and more rural hospitals will be able to keep their doors open.
</p><p><b>Establish Georgia’s Health Equity Action Team</b>
</p><p>Georgians face a maze of state agencies, private providers and insurance regulations when they simply want to get well. Our action team will cut through the red tape to improve the health and well-being of all Georgians. I will also require the health plans doing business with the state to identify and address health care disparities in access and outcomes within the populations they serve.
</p><p><b>Increase Health Care Worker Development and Retention</b>
</p><p>Health care workers are experiencing burnout, depression and anxiety. Since February 2020, the health care industry is down 306,000 jobs nationwide. More than half of acute and critical care nurses are thinking about leaving the profession, exacerbating existing nursing shortages. We must address chronic and new health care worker staffing shortages as well as burnout in the health care profession and recruit and retain health care providers in our rural communities. I will also re-invest in our state’s public health infrastructure and grow our network of community health workers, doulas, home-visiting service providers and peer support specialists to help Georgians get connected to and use the health care, behavioral health and social services they need to be healthy and productive.
</p><p><b>Create Covid Outreach Protocol</b>
</p><p>Ensure that treatment is accessible and affordable for the thousands of families with loved ones in nursing homes or otherwise in treatment for Long Covid. Also work with the state’s attorney general to ensure federal anti-discrimination laws are enforced in cases when Long Covid becomes a disability.
</p><p><b>Create Covid Long-term Recovery Plan</b>
</p><p>Produce and regularly update a science-based, real-world-informed, transparent plan for how we address the long-term transition from pandemic to endemic Covid in our schools, businesses and public entities. The pandemic has touched every aspect of our lives: we have experienced profound loss, trauma and disruptions to our health care system, workplaces, financial circumstances, schools and communities. These effects will not disappear by declaring Covid over. We must monitor and respond to the known and unforeseen consequences of a once-a-century health crisis.
</p><p><b>Defend Reproductive Rights</b>
</p><p>Defend the rights of women and families to make healthcare decisions, and the rights of doctors to provide care. Ensure that all Georgians have access to the health care they need, including reproductive health care. Expand Medicaid to address Georgia’s maternal and infant mortality crises.
</p><p><br />
<b>Military Families and Veterans Support</b>
</p><p>Georgia is home to thirteen military installments, nearly two million military family members, and one of America’s most robust veteran populations. Georgia must keep our nation’s promises to them, and we must ensure that their skills and experiences are properly valued as a vital part of our state and our economy.
</p><p><b>Improve Transitions from Service to School and Career</b>
</p><p>Many service members finish their service and need added resources to transition to civilian life; the “A Promise Kept” initiative was an important first step, but more must be done to support these transitions.
</p><p><b>Georgia Veterans Work Opportunity Tax Credit</b>
</p><p>Incentivize employers to hire veterans and count experience gained while in the military towards pay scale and position.
</p><p><b>Georgia Veterans Higher Ed Initiative</b>
</p><p>Continue to decrease barriers for veterans to pursue higher education by providing dedicated veteran support staff at every college and university, more credit transfer opportunities and additional financial support.
</p><p><b>End Veteran Homelessness</b>
</p><p>End veteran homelessness in Georgia through a federal, state and nonprofit joint venture to quickly identify veterans without homes, veterans on housing waiting lists and at-risk veterans to connect them to permanent, affordable housing and supportive services.
</p><p><b>Protect Our Defenders Act</b>
</p><p>Secure comprehensive legislation to support our veterans on issues ranging from predatory lending, suicide prevention, inadequate healthcare, and post-deployment poverty.
</p><p><b>Create the Office of Military Inclusion</b>
</p><p>Tackle challenges facing veterans of color, women veterans and LGBTQ+ veterans by coordinating specialized outreach efforts and addressing the health, housing, education, employment and legal challenges of these communities.
</p><p><br />
<b>Environmental Action</b>
</p><p>We must build and preserve an environment in our state that recognizes how vital clean air and water are to our lives and our economy, that anticipates the increase in extreme weather events and its effect on Georgia families, and that leads in the transition to renewable energy while creating jobs and new industries. My environmental action plan will generate significant job growth through advanced energy generation, innovative technologies and energy efficiency efforts. We will train and retrain workers for good-paying jobs in advanced energy sectors, and we will coordinate state and local action and develop public-private partnerships for greater impact across the state to implement advanced energy solutions.
</p><p><b>Create New Jobs from Manufacturing to Coding</b>
</p><p>Advanced energy creates career pathways from the entry-level to high-skilled across fields and sectors, including initial estimates of 25,000-40,000 jobs. Georgia will expand access to well-paying careers in manufacturing, system design, project development, construction, installation and operations – all critical to an advanced energy economy. The manufacturing-intensive advanced energy industry promotes work for engineers, machinists, coders and installers, but also administrators, accountants, truck drivers, sales force and a range of other occupations.
</p><p><b>Develop a Environmental Tech Workforce</b>
</p><p>Workforce training, apprenticeships and partnerships with labor and educational institutions will ensure opportunities exist for all workers, and Georgia will follow best practices to ensure women and under-represented groups participate
</p><p><b>Ensure Equitable Regional Investment</b>
</p><p>Advanced energy jobs can be developed across the state of Georgia. Already, places like Mitchell County and Tybee Island have leveraged advanced energy to create new jobs and opportunities through solar, and Georgia’s successful timber industry has created a sustainable market for biomass. Hydro, wind, solar and biomass energy have economic impact across the state, and with collaboration and focus, these energy sources can become engines of prosperity for more Georgians.
</p><p><b>Eliminate Fees and Lower Utility Costs</b>
</p><p>Georgia will increase ease of adoption of solar and clean energy sources, which can lower the cost of utilities for the average user. By state law, Georgia allows financing for property owners who may use loans for energy efficiency improvements and make payments on the loan through property tax assessments, but implementation has lagged. Georgia will work with local governments to increase the energy efficiency opportunities for Georgians.
</p><p><b>Green Savings Plan for Taxpayers</b>
</p><p>Georgia will adopt green government initiatives that foster energy efficiency and reduce waste, which will not only create jobs but also save taxpayer dollars. Simple actions like updating building codes, examining power grids and shifting to purchasing clean energy vehicles can amount to savings for taxpayers. We will also increase energy efficiency throughout Georgia by offering financial incentives for meeting high public construction energy standards.
</p><p><b>Conduct Georgia Green-Mapping Project for Investors</b>
</p><p>From wind and hydro opportunities in North Georgia, to biomass in South Georgia and solar capacity across the state, advanced energy innovation uses natural resources in a sustainable manner. Farmers and timberland owners have already begun to use existing landholdings for access to solar farms, and with the right partnerships, Georgia can more effectively utilize our varied topography.
</p><p><b>Establish the Georgia Green Development Bank</b>
</p><p>Seed private investment, set attainable renewable energy targets for our electric utilities, target tax credits towards advanced energy generation and work with all interested local communities to streamline the adoption of solar and advanced energy power projects to create 25,000 jobs.
</p><p><b>Expand Georgia’s Carbon Sequestration Registry</b>
</p><p>Systematically enroll all appropriate state properties in concert with private market investors. The public share of its financial proceeds will be applied to meeting green development goals statewide.
</p><p><b>Activate Georgia’s Youth Conservation Corps</b>
</p><p>Invest in and leverage this program for training and employment in residential energy efficiency implementation and working with our state’s utilities to explore opportunities to modernize our electric power grid.
</p><p><b>Protect Our Water Supply</b>
</p><p>Pursue legislative and regulatory solutions to toxic coal ash waste by requiring safe storage of coal ash, engage in continuous monitoring of all such toxic storage sites for leaks, and immediately provide alternative water supplies and groundwater remediation when leaks occur.
</p><p><b>Protect Our People Initiative</b>
</p><p>Direct Georgia’s Environmental Protection Division to take action to protect Georgians from dangerous toxins in our environment, to define a protocol to address <u>“forever chemicals”</u> dumped in North Georgia and in the Ogeechee River and set a firm timetable for final remediation of the state’s inventory of hazardous sites. Also budget for state agencies to address commercial, industrial and agricultural waste.
</p><p><br />
<b>Public Safety and Criminal Justice Reform</b>
</p><p>Under Governor Nathan Deal’s administration, Georgia made important strides to reform our justice system and protect public safety. The reforms were propelled by the acknowledgement that (1) we were paying an enormous price tag for a system that was not giving us the results we needed and (2) we can and must do better to achieve real justice. The reforms resulted in not only an overall decline in our prison population, but also a 30% decrease in the number of Black people incarcerated over the 8-year period. Additionally, the number of youth in secure confinement and secure detention fell by more than a third and 11%, respectively.
</p><p>However, the work was far from complete when Governor Deal left office. And regrettably, over the last four years, the neglect of the system has resulted in serious consequences. Georgia’s incarceration rate– 968 per 100,000 people (including prisons, jails, immigration detention, and juvenile justice facilities) – is one of the highest in the nation, and higher than any country in the world. We <u>lead the nation with our probation rate</u>, more than triple the national average and nearly double the number of the second-ranked state.
</p><p>Tragically, these numbers corresponded to increased violence for Georgians under the current administration. Gun violence and homicides <u>have increased dramatically between 2019-2020</u> in urban, suburban and rural areas. Georgia’s prisons have deteriorated to the point that a comprehensive investigation has been launched by the <u>US Department of Justice</u>. The dangerous working conditions inside Georgia prisons are resulting in our state’s corrections officers leaving the system in droves.
</p><p>Brian Kemp is proposing <u>$600M to “improve” old prisons</u> currently. We cannot build or buy our way out of this predicament. Now is the time to hold those who have committed crimes accountable and prioritize public safety, but we must also make strategic interventions to reduce our prison population to avoid creating cycles of recidivism.
</p><p>Our reforms will be data-driven and evidence-based, but also experience-based— we need to learn from the lived experience of families across this state to ensure more of our fellow Georgians can be part of our economy rather than part of our justice system.
</p><p><b>Mandate Standard Minimum Salary for Law Enforcement</b>
</p><p>Establish and fund a standard minimum salary for all law enforcement, not a $1,000 one-time bonus. Trust between communities and law enforcement is essential and has suffered.. Law enforcement must know that they are valued and they should be able to live in the areas they serve. To change our future, we must acknowledge the disproportionate impact of the criminal legal system on communities of color throughout Georgia’s past.
</p><p><b>Renew the Criminal Justice Reform Council</b>
</p><p>Reignite our commitment to doing better for all Georgians by building upon the bipartisan work of Governor Deal’s Criminal Justice Reform Council. Convene stakeholders from across the criminal justice spectrum to enact evidence-based solutions and rebuild a system that works effectively for all, is more just and builds safer communities.
</p><p><b>Update POST Training and Increase Transparency</b>
</p><p>Collaborate with the Georgia Peace Officers Standards and Training Council to develop law enforcement training standards that help de-escalate violence, improve engagement with vulnerable populations and reduce the need for use of force. Transparent law enforcement policies foster trust and build the relationships that make our communities safer.
</p><p><b>Decrease Barriers to Successful Reentry</b>
</p><p>A key component of successful reentry is supporting people who remain crime-free after returning to their community in moving on to a better lives. <u>4.2 million Georgians (over 1/3 of the state’s population) have a criminal record</u>. People with criminal records can find themselves blocked from housing, employment, education and other opportunities for the rest of their lives. This can be done through restricting access or clearing old criminal records, a process that Georgia has started in recent years but has further to go. Enacting “clean slate” legislation would offer automatic criminal record clearing once someone remains crime-free for a set period of time. <u>Five states</u> have already implemented these policies, including Virginia in 2021.
</p><p><b>Decriminalize Poverty</b>
</p><p>Poverty should not be a condition of justice, and we can change these outcomes by eliminating private probation, improving pre-trial services and supervision, increasing diversion programs and accountability courts (like veterans’ courts and drug courts) and providing for civil penalties rather than criminal penalties for certain traffic and low-level drug offenses.
</p><p><b>Restore Slashed Funding to Diversion Programs</b>
</p><p>Diverting at-risk youth at an early age can prevent their entrance into the juvenile justice system. A strong investment in prevention and early intervention programs, particularly for at-risk youth in undeserved communities, makes kids and communities safer.
</p><p><br />
<b>Voting Rights</b>
</p><p>As founder of multiple organizations promoting and protecting the right to vote, I have demonstrated a commitment to a strong democracy in Georgia and beyond. Every eligible Georgian should have the ability to register to vote, to cast a ballot and to have that ballot properly recorded – without systematic barriers. As governor, I will prioritize voting rights as essential to democracy and effective government. I will leverage both administrative authority and advocate for legislation to accomplish the following:
</p><p><b>Improved Voter Registration Practices and Proper Safeguards</b>
</p><p>Georgians who are eligible to vote but who did not have an opportunity to register should be able to register and vote on Election Day with proper safeguards. We will ensure conventional paper voter registration applications are processed within 20 days of receipt. We will prioritize top-level security investment for all voting infrastructure, including voter registration systems
</p><p><b>Support Counties and Ensure Voting is Convenient</b>
</p><p>We will make sure counties have the training, resources and flexibility needed to serve their voters and work with the Secretary of State to provide consistency for voters across 159 counties. Voting in Georgia must be made more accessible by mandating fair allocation of polling places and polling place resources during early voting and on Election Day. Polling locations must be stable, convenient and equitable to voters. We will invest in mobile voting precincts to assist seniors, disabled Georgians and Georgians voting in areas with long wait times. Postage for mail ballots should be free.
</p><p><b>End Arbitrary Rejection of Ballots</b>
</p><p>Votes must count if they are cast in a voter’s county – just as is the practice during early voting periods. Mail ballots must count if they are postmarked up to and including Election Day.
</p><p><b>Stop Gerrymandering at State and Local Level</b>
</p><p>I will veto maps with gerrymandered districts, whether state legislative or Congressional. Moreover, we must end the practice of state interference and restore local control in local elections.<sup id="cite_ref-quotedisclaimer_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-quotedisclaimer-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup>

<p><b>Bold, Ambitious Children</b><br />
Building a Georgia where every child believes their future should be limitless
We are ready to imagine more for our children than simply an adequate education. Georgia must invest in addressing the needs of the whole child from cradle to career – and our investment must extend beyond the walls of a classroom to acknowledge the totality of their needs. Urban, suburban, and rural families all face the challenge of accessing quality education. This begins with high-quality affordable childcare and universal access to pre-kindergarten programs, continues through K-12 and must prepare students for higher education. But too often, a family’s income or zip code determines if their child has a strong beginning or receives an education to power a lifetime of opportunity. We must guarantee an excellent education as the best guarantee for mobility and success.
</p><p><br /> 
</p><p>NEW: The Bold Action for a Brighter Future Plan: Georgia has the resources to serve our children – and as Governor, Stacey Abrams will have the vision and will to educate bold and ambitious children as our best legacy. The new Bold Action for a Brighter Future Plan is a proposal to extend access to high-quality child care programs, ensure affordable options for children ages 0-3, increase access to pre-K, improve the livelihoods of teachers and expand statewide access to afterschool programs. Our children will be proof of our investment, and our workforce will be more productive. Read more about the newly released child care plan HERE.
</p><p><br />
High-Quality Day Care: Learning begins at birth, which means we have to start our commitment to education with high-quality, affordable child care. Georgia can afford to offer tax credits and subsidies to our working parents to take care of our youngest citizens. Quality early care has been tied to school readiness, graduation rates, reading proficiency, and college-going rates.
</p><p><br />
Universal Pre-K: As Governor, Stacey is committed to reaffirming the promise of universal pre-K for four-year-olds.
</p><p><br />
Excellent Public Schools: Public education is the beating heart of our state and a fundamental obligation. We must invest in excellent public schools by providing early and regular assessment of students’ capacity to learn: supporting their physical, emotional and mental health rather than simply testing their ability to take tests. As Minority Leader, Stacey advocated for fully-funded quality public education that promotes excellence, demanded comprehensive support for struggling schools and opposed attempts to privatize our public schools. Georgia leaders cannot stand up for public education and simultaneously vote for private vouchers; diversion of funds to private schools undermines our government’s responsibility.
</p><p><br />
Post-Secondary Pathways: Providing Georgians with access to affordable higher education is essential to building a strong workforce in our state. As Minority Leader, Stacey Abrams negotiated the inclusion of a 1% low-interest loan program for higher education and remedial classes for technical college students, and she fought for a need-based aid program in the state. As Governor, she will push for free access to technical college, debt-free four-year college, and need-based aid as a priority in Georgia. Under her leadership, Georgia will expand access to apprenticeships and invest in adult literacy options.
</p><p><b>A Fair and Diverse Economy</b><br />
A state where the economy works in every county, for every Georgian
We must build a Georgia where no one has to work more than one full-time job to make ends meet. A fair economy means investing in diverse businesses, fighting for equality in the workplace, lifting families out of poverty, and ensuring access to affordable healthcare. Fairness is the backbone of an economy that eliminates poverty and fosters prosperity for every family.
</p><p><br />
NEW: Jobs for Georgia Plan – From our port in Savannah and a bustling film industry that strengthens local small businesses to the nation’s busiest airport, Georgia’s economy has become the envy of the South. However, our economy fails too many of our business owners and workers in several ways. Small businesses have trouble accessing capital, finding the skilled labor they need, accessing critical infrastructure like broadband, and fear the chilling effects of divisive rhetoric from politicians. Together, we can build an economy as strong and diverse as our citizens, one that unlocks the entrepreneurial spirit of Georgians across our state and fosters innovation. Read the Jobs for Georgia plan here.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<pre>The Georgia Economic Mobility Plan – Georgia families deserve a leader who will invest in every person, and who has an economic mobility vision that will increase prosperity, lift families from poverty, reduce income inequality, and ensure a fair and inclusive economy for all Georgians. As Georgia’s next governor, Stacey Abrams will prioritize economic mobility to ensure every hardworking family has the chance to succeed and prosper. The Georgia Economic Mobility Plan will grow the economy for all Georgians. It will focus on earnings, savings, skills, worker protections and inclusion: Read the plan here.

</pre>
<p>Georgia’s Advanced Energy Jobs Plan is the first in a series of economic revitalization proposals to deliver 25,000-45,000 long-term, high wage jobs in Georgia – from construction, coding, sales, and installation to manufacturing and beyond. Georgia must have a bold and comprehensive economic vision to (1) ensure no person has to work more than one full-time job to make ends meet and (2) catalyze the creation of good-paying jobs in all 159 counties, at all skill levels. We must leverage our natural resources and assets, working together across sectors, to build an economy for every worker. Let’s imagine more for our state and create an economy that leads the nation in advanced energy jobs and local innovation. Read the plan here.
</p><p><br />
Investment in Community Businesses: Small businesses employ more Georgians, and they can be started anywhere. As Governor, Stacey Abrams will direct more of our economic development dollars to our hometown businesses: the barbershop that wants to expand, the nurse who wants to launch a home health care company, the entrepreneur who can’t get venture capital in rural Georgia. Funds will be targeted to reach low-income communities and rural counties, and we will help Georgia businesses expand by offering access to capital.
</p><p><br />
Workplace Equality: We must demand that our workplaces never discriminate based on a person’s race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, disability, or immigration status. As Governor, Stacey Abrams will promote policies to ensure pay equity and expand paid sick leave. Georgia should require a living wage in every county. Furthermore, the right to form a union and collectively bargain for fair wages and employment conditions is fundamental to workplace fairness. As Minority Leader, Stacey Abrams has never wavered in her opposition to legislation that would erode the rights of workers to bargain for fair pay and safe workplace conditions. While in the legislature, Stacey Abrams co-sponsored legislation to prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation by amending the Fair Employment Practices Act. As Governor, Stacey Abrams will continue to support a Georgia civil rights bill to protect the LGBTQ+ community, as well as immigrants, people of color, and people of faith, from discrimination in housing, public accommodation, and the workplace; create a body dedicated to enforcing these laws; and put in place protections to all relevant sections of Georgia law. Stacey Abrams supports passage of hate crime legislation to protect LGBTQ+ Georgians and other communities facing discrimination.
</p><p><br />
Lift Families Out of Poverty: Moving from poverty to prosperity must be the mission of our next governor. Economic mobility improves neighborhoods and schools and decreases reliance on welfare programs and incarceration rates. As Minority Leader, Stacey defeated Republican tax plans to increase sales taxes on working families, and she opposed legislation to restore taxes on groceries. As Governor Abrams would improve tackle poverty among our working families by establishing a state Earned Income Tax Credit, bridging transition from welfare to work without immediately eliminating benefits, and expanding access to childcare tax credits and subsidies. She will also continue her fight to protect workers from misclassification as independent contractors and abusive on-call scheduling, providing families with predictable workweeks and predictable paychecks.
</p><p><br />
Access to Affordable Healthcare: Access to affordable healthcare is a right, and guaranteeing quality services improves families, communities and the workplace. As Minority Leader, Stacey worked to sign Georgians up for the Affordable Care Act and she has fought for Medicaid expansion – the only path forward for providing essential health coverage to the working poor and preventing the closure of our rural hospitals and the economic collapse of surrounding communities. Stacey has spearheaded critical legislation combatting the misclassification of workers as independent contractors, which denies them Medicaid benefits they have earned. When elected governor, Stacey will work to expand Medicaid and provide coverage for 500,000 Georgians, create 56,000 jobs, stabilize our rural counties and explore pathways to universal coverage in our state. She will support reproductive freedom and access to treatment for women, regardless of ability to pay. Also, across our state, more than half of our counties lack access to OB/GYNs or pediatricians. Stacey will leverage state and federal programs to incentivize more doctors and medical personnel to locate in under-served areas, and she will work with practitioners to reduce our maternal and infant mortality rates and increase access to care.
</p><p>Innovation and Green Jobs: Growing Georgia’s economy means we must diversify our jobs and support innovation across sectors. With the right policies, Georgia can lead the Southeast in advanced energy jobs. As Governor, Stacey will work with public and private partners to create new jobs in infrastructure, clean energy, biotech and agritech, as well as expand broadband to connect our communities to the Internet. We can train our students in growing fields like energy engineering, sustainability science and build an energy innovation ecosystem across the state.
</p><p><b>Effective and Engaged Government</b><br />
Creating a Georgia where all of us are active partners in ensuring government serves everyone
Georgians must be able to rely on their government to defend their rights, fix systemic problems and protect its residents. Too often, government only works for the wealthy and well-connected. Worse, poor policymaking has a disproportionate impact on people of color, the poor and rural communities. From criminal justice reform to voting rights to environmental justice to supporting seniors or the disabled, we must have an effective and engaged government.
</p><p><br />
NEW: Justice for Georgia: A Plan for Fairness and Community Safety –Criminal justice reform is a central component of Stacey Abrams’ mission to create an effective and engaged government. Together, we will work to build a justice system that serves every Georgian. The Justice for Georgia plan will improve court, jail, and prison systems, lower incarceration rates, reduce recidivism, aid law enforcement, and make our communities safer by building trust throughout Georgia. We cannot return to the tired, dated patterns of “punish and penalize.” In 2018, we must elect leadership with a bold new vision for what Georgia can be. Read the plan here.
</p><p><br />
Defend Our Rights: An effective government must protect civil rights and fight discrimination based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, immigration status, disability, or gender identity. Stacey co-sponsored civil rights legislation for Georgia. She opposed the disastrous HB 87, which has harmed our immigrant and refugee communities. As Minority Leader, Stacey fought back voter suppression tactics and introduced legislation to expand access to the ballot. Through the New Georgia Project, Stacey registered more than 200,000 people of color, forced the restoration of 33,000 illegally canceled voter applications, and defeated attempts to intimidate voters. As Governor, she will oppose policies that seek to undermine the rights of Georgians.
</p><p><br />
Fix Systemic Problems: Stacey has championed legislation to protect our natural resources and our communities from the hazardous waste that too often has gone unchecked. She supported greater oversight of petroleum pipelines so communities could know the possible impacts ahead of time. Stacey sponsored legislation to ensure funds for hazardous waste clean-up actually go to that purpose, as well as legislation to require landfills to alert the public in the event of a leak. From clean water to solar energy, Stacey has been a leader on moving Georgia to a more sustainable future for all.
</p><p><br />
Decriminalize Poverty and Support Justice: Justice should not be determined by your paycheck. Stacey Abrams’ policies will lift families out of poverty and also combat the criminalization of poverty. We must end the unequal application of justice for those who can buy their way out of jail versus those who cannot. Stacey will focus on reforming bail policies and eliminating “cash bail,” decriminalizing traffic offenses and possession of small amounts of marijuana, increasing training that recognizes implicit bias, and stopping the shameful practices of private probation companies. We must expand reforms to support community policing and improve POST training to rebuild trust between law enforcement and our most vulnerable communities. However, criminal justice reform cannot focus solely on sentencing and prisons. Reform efforts must also recognize that disparities in school funding, health care access, and job opportunities are inextricably related to combating over-incarceration and prolonged probation sentences.
</p><p><br />
Protect Our Most Vulnerable Residents: Nearly a quarter of Georgia’s children live in poverty and approximately 11,000 children in foster care. More than 100,000 children are in kinship care – being raised by grandparents or other kin. Nearly 10% of seniors are below the poverty line, and thousands of seniors are in need of resources to help them age in place. As a state, we must deliver critical services to those who have physical, intellectual, and developmental disabilities as well as mental illness. As Minority Leader, Stacey has co-sponsored legislation to support our most vulnerable residents, from kinship care legislation to expanding legal protections for seniors. As Governor, Stacey will continue to advocate for policies and funds to serve these communities.
</p><p><b>Justice for Georgia: A Plan for Fairness and Community Safety</b><br />
Dear Fellow Georgians:
</p><p>My younger brother Walter is brilliant, dynamic, and one of the kindest people I’ve ever known, but he suffers from mental health issues that went undiagnosed and untreated because my family lacked health insurance and access to services. Instead of getting help, Walter self-medicated, made bad choices to support his drug habit, and is now serving time in prison. He missed last Christmas with our family, with his daughter. He struggles every day with both his illness and his drug addiction. But Walter’s path could have been different with the right interventions.
</p><p>Too many Georgians know Walter’s story all too well. The old way in Georgia said that mental health treatment wasn’t a smart investment for our state. The old way in Georgia ensured missteps and mistakes followed a person for life, impacting whether they could ever get a job or decent housing. The old way did not see a future in Georgia for men and women like Walter. In the last decade, a bipartisan consensus has emerged that our criminal justice system must head in a new direction. Republicans and Democrats realized Georgia could not continue to afford to be a leader in mass incarceration, which costs too much money and sets people up for permanent failure. Georgia has started on a path to a smarter approach—one the next governor must continue.
</p><p>We cannot return to the tired, dated patterns of “punish and penalize.” In 2018, we must elect leadership with a bold new vision for what Georgia can be.
</p><p>Leaders across the state know my commitment to criminal justice reform, and the Governor of Georgia has trusted me to sit at the table and work for common sense solutions. I served on the Special Joint Committee on Criminal Justice Reform, the Sentencing Subcommittee, Probation Reform Task Force, and the Special Council on Criminal Justice Reform for Georgians. During my tenure, I helped pass changes to reduce sentencing for non-violent offenders, shift Georgia’s policies on private probation, improve our parole system, adopt a new juvenile justice code and obtain eligibility for vocational licenses for ex-offenders. The Governor also appointed me to the Judicial Nominating Committee, where I advocated for true diversity representation in our courts and the appointment of innovative judges who have adopted smart-on-crime policies. I am committed to working collaboratively with the courts, state agencies, law enforcement, community-based partners, and the legislature to continue and expand criminal justice reform.
</p><p>When elected as governor, I look forward to that first call with my brother—a call to share my joy with him and to say a prayer for him as he serves the remainder of his time. Part of what makes this campaign different is that my story is the story of Georgia, and I’m not afraid to tell it—the good and the bad. If we can be candid about the struggles in our families and our communities, then we can find real solutions.
</p><p>The solutions in my Justice for Georgia Plan will decriminalize poverty and provide pathways to restoration for those who have committed crimes but want to do better. Right now, if you have money, you can artfully navigate the criminal justice system and maybe even avoid it altogether. But, if you are poor, you are often overwhelmed by the system. Right now, the majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have not been convicted of a crime. Many are simply too poor to pay their bail. The Constitution says that punishment is for the convicted, not the merely arrested, and Georgia must be on the right side of the law. The collateral consequences of our justice system have wide-ranging impacts, including loss of jobs, children sent into foster care, loss of housing and more people shifted from work to the social safety net. The entire community is affected, and everyone becomes less secure.
</p><p>We spend too much money locking people up without proof this makes our communities safer or spends taxpayer dollars wisely. Instead of safety, we get higher unemployment and less community stability. Georgia cannot turn away from our progress, and we have much more to do. The cost to our families and our economy is too great. My vision is a Georgia built on fairness and where poverty is not a life sentence. In addition to working to end money bail for nonviolent offenses, I will focus on decriminalizing certain traffic offenses, limiting the forfeiture of drivers licenses for failure to pay fines, increasing fairness in the assessment and imposition of criminal justice debt, adequately funding indigent defense, improving access to community-based mental health and substance abuse programs and other solutions to ensure that incomes do not determine outcomes in the justice system.
</p><p>My Justice for Georgia Plan addresses five key areas. Tackling each of these areas will improve court, jail, and prison systems, lower incarceration rates, reduce recidivism, aid law enforcement, and make our communities safer by building trust throughout Georgia.
</p><p>Decriminalization of poverty through eliminating money bail, improving pretrial services and supervision, increasing diversion programs and accountability courts (like veterans courts, drug courts, etc.), and providing for civil penalties rather than criminal penalties for certain traffic offenses and marijuana possession.
Re-entry and transition program expansion through improving the coordination of services with state agencies like the Department of Corrections and the Department of Community Supervision, developing strong public-private partnerships with employers, housing providers and educational institutions and protecting people from unfair discrimination based on their criminal history.
Juvenile justice reform through raising the age of juvenile court jurisdiction to 18, the continuation of the Juvenile Justice Incentive Grant Program and other necessary improvements.
Effective community policing through engagement with community members to proactively identify and address issues that impact the quality of life in neighborhoods and to further assist law enforcement in obtaining the resources—including training and data-driven solutions—they need to protect the communities in which they serve.
Criminal justice reform is one part of improving the safety and security for all Georgians. We must invest in prevention and early intervention through education, jobs, mental health and substance abuse treatment, and affordable housing. That’s why my campaign has and will continue to release plans for Medicaid expansion, jobs in all 159 counties, 0-4 early childhood programs and K-12 education and training opportunities, and other solutions to move Georgians from survival to success.
</p><p>As governor, I will focus on the barriers facing Georgians who are trying to move ahead and move beyond their past. Our reforms will be data-driven and evidence-based, but also experience-based—we need to learn from the lived experience of families across this state to ensure more of our fellow Georgians can be part of our economy rather than part of our justice system.
</p><p>Criminal justice reform is a central component of my mission to create effective and engaged government. Together, we will work to build a justice system that serves every Georgian—a critical way to make sure government works for everyone.
</p><p><b>The Bold Action for a Brighter Future Plan</b><br />
Dear Fellow Georgians:
</p><p>In Laurens County, two busy parents drop off their two-year-old at a daycare center, worried about the bill that’s due at the end of the week. A single mom in Gwinnett heads back to work, her newborn in the care of a neighbor, which is all she can afford. Grandparents in Catoosa County, raising their three grandkids – ages 3, 7 and 11 – stay up late trying to figure out how they can stretch their budget for their new family.
</p><p>Regardless of the family, taking care of our children from cradle to career stands as a clear and foundational goal. Quality child care and early learning are critical to fostering school readiness, graduation rates, reading proficiency and college-going rates. Afterschool programs deepen learning and support families where school ends before work does. Employees who have peace of mind about child care arrangements are more stable and productive workers, which in turn makes our state more competitive when attracting business. Workers also benefit by staying employed longer and earning more income.  
</p><p>Early learning is profoundly beneficial to our young children, who have higher cognitive and academic achievement scores in their teen years if they spent time in high-quality daycare as young children. From high-quality child care to pre-K, Georgia has long been a leader in early childhood learning, including launching one of the nation’s first universal, full-day pre-K programs for four-year-olds and its Bright from the Start standards. Yet, for families across our state today, quality child care has become expensive or unattainable. Afterschool programs improve academic performance and behavioral outcomes for children. For parents who work, programs can be a crucial support system, but too many communities have limited options.
</p><p>Nearly half a million Georgia children under the age of six have both parents in the labor force, but access to quality child care, especially programs focused on early learning, remains a barrier for too many of our families. The average cost for infant care in Georgia is almost $7,700 annually – more than average in-state public college tuition – and those costs are rising. Child care for two children costs more than average rent in most parts of the state. According to one estimate, 62% of Georgia families pay more than 10% of their income to child care, and not enough families receive the subsidies they need to access quality care. Moreover, for non-traditional families, like grandparents and other relatives raising grandchildren, the state provides limited support for the more than 100,000 children who are in kinship care.
</p><p>Location also has a tremendous impact on access. Thousands of children across the state, particularly in rural communities, live in educational care deserts where their parents are unable to find or afford high-quality child care. Sixty-two counties in Georgia do not have access to the main federal funding streams for afterschool. Child care workers are paid at abysmally low rates, and the barriers to enter the field are often too great for those who wish to do so. This hurts our children’s futures, cuts worker productivity and stifles our state’s growth.
</p><p>Quality educational care grows resilient children, provides stability for employers whose employees know their children are in good hands, and invests in the future workforce, beginning in early childhood.
</p><p>MY VISION FOR GEORGIA: Georgia will educate bold and ambitious children from cradle to career. As Governor, I will extend access to high-quality child care programs, ensure affordable options for children ages 0-3, increase access to pre-K, improve the livelihoods of teachers and expand statewide access to afterschool programs. Our children will be proof of our investment, and our workforce will be more productive.
</p><p>Georgia has the resources to serve our children – and as Governor, I will have the vision and will to educate bold and ambitious children as our best legacy.
</p><p>By eliminating tax loopholes as well as the $58 million tax handout that diverts public dollars to private K-12 schools, we can invest in our youngest Georgians and support the economic health of our families across the state.

</p><p><b>Georgia's Advanced Energy Jobs Plan</b><br />
Dear Fellow Georgians:
</p><p>We deserve an economy that works in every county, for every Georgian, and helps families thrive — not just survive.
</p><p>Parts of our state enjoy a strong economy, but too many families and communities are left out of economic success. Despite a reputation for a robust business environment, Georgia is losing middle income households, and it remains one of the top ten states for income inequality and poverty. Nearly a quarter of a million Georgians are unemployed and searching for work their towns cannot produce without partnership from an effective state government.
</p><p>For too long, the solution has been to promote temporary or potentially unstable job creation in a handful of counties through tax incentives for large corporations. These announcements deliver headlines, but these projects do not always deliver consistent, good-paying jobs.
</p><p>Georgia must have a bold and comprehensive economic vision to (1) ensure no person has to work more than one full-time job to make ends meet and (2) catalyze the creation of good-paying jobs in all 159 counties, at all skill levels. As a successful entrepreneur who has worked in infrastructure, capital investment and manufacturing, I understand how critical a diverse and thriving economy is to our families – and how we must leverage our natural resources and assets, working together across sectors, to build an economy for every worker.
</p><p>Our proposal outlines the first in a series of economic development priorities I will spearhead as Georgia’s next governor: Georgia’s Advanced Energy Jobs Plan.
</p><p>Georgia can deliver high-quality employment for our state by creating an economy that leads the nation in advanced energy jobs and local innovation – using our people, our climate and our ingenuity to expand the path to prosperity for Georgians everywhere.
</p><p>Advanced energy has become a stable but under-utilized source of economic growth for Georgia.
</p><p>Our economic future demands bold action. Through our Advanced Energy Jobs Plan, we will lead the South as a state where advanced energy innovation is a core component of our economic expansion.
</p><p>Georgia deserves a leader who sees clean, advanced energy as a stable source of economic development, a public health necessity, and an environmental justice imperative.
</p><p>I will build a fair and thriving economy in every county in Georgia. We will consistently invest in Georgia’s home-grown businesses, fight for equality in the workplace, and promote a healthy workforce as essential components to lifting families out of poverty and strengthening the middle class. Georgia’s transition to an advanced energy economy is a crucial component to achieving that reality.
</p><p>The work to make advanced energy policy a reality that uplifts local communities cannot be fulfilled without first having conversations with Georgians about how it will impact their daily lives. I look forward to traveling the state to share this vision with families and hear more about how we can best work together for our state’s economic future.

</p><p><b>Immigrant Justice</b><br />
Immigrant Justice
To Georgia’s Immigrant Communities:
</p><p>You strengthen our state, and you are vital to its future. Your success lifts us all, and I stand with you.
</p><p>I talk every day about my mission to build a Georgia where everyone has the freedom and opportunity to thrive. And I want to be clear: I do mean everyone who resides in our state. Nearly one in ten Georgians migrated here from another country. Together, though, we have one of the nation’s strongest economies and a legacy of civil and human rights. When every person in our state is included in Georgia’s progress, our communities and economy grow stronger.  
</p><p>Our mission is to build a state of excellent public schools where we educate children from cradle to career; to expand access to health care; to build a thriving and diverse economy with jobs that create wealth and opportunity; and to support entrepreneurs of all backgrounds to start and grow small businesses. We must do all of this hand in hand with the diverse immigrant communities across our state.
</p><p>My faith demands that I speak up for the voiceless and the vulnerable – that a soul finds rest only by doing the most for the “least of these.” 
</p><p>My soul rests with those seeking asylum and refuge, with new Americans, naturalized citizens, and all those on the long, arduous path toward citizenship. I know this journey is not easy – but believing in the promise and potential of America, and seeing yourself as a part of its future, is the first step.
</p><p>My soul rests with those who have made Georgia home – those who took the original promise of the Statue of Liberty, “Mother of Exiles,” to heart – and now fight to hold her promises true for others. 
</p><p>Only then can we make Georgia a better place to live and raise a family – for EVERY family. 
</p><p>For some time, and particularly in the last few years, you have shown incredible strength in the face of brutal attacks. The anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions of this administration are cruel, inhumane, and must be opposed in the strongest terms.
</p><p>United, we have the power – and the duty – to transform our Georgia for the better. 
</p><p><b>The Georgia Economic Mobility Plan</b><br />
Dear Fellow Georgians:
</p><p>Recently, I was sitting in traffic and heard the wail of sirens. The light changed, and every car stayed put to let the ambulance race through the intersection. In those moments, I felt a sense of pride for those who idled in their cars around me. We each had our own destinations, and we wanted to get there as quickly as possible. Yet, when we hear those sirens, we stop. We wait. We make way for those who need us to carve a path.
</p><p>Across our state, our fellow Georgians are fighting for survival. They have lost access to hospitals and the jobs they’ve relied upon for years, and they struggle with low or stagnant wages that never seem to rise. Too many are grappling with hunger, poverty, and addiction. Millennials are inheriting a state where the economy can seem inaccessible, and folks in every county are trapped by lack of opportunity. While some Georgians are moving forward and ahead, too many are blocked and denied mobility. Let’s be clear: this is not just an issue for the working poor. Middle class families also work harder for less and need pathways to greater economic security and wealth.            
</p><p>I am excited about leading Georgia because I know we have the resources, the smarts, and the capacity to make way for more Georgians to thrive. That’s what I’m bringing to the governor’s office—the leadership and experience to do this.
</p><p>Georgia has a strong economy for some, but not all of us. Our state has lagged in equality and shared success — ranking among the top ten states for poverty rates with families struggling to meet their basic needs. Nationally, 70% of children born at the bottom do not reach middle class in their adulthood.
</p><p>As Georgia’s next governor, I will prioritize economic mobility as key to ensuring our state is known as a place for prosperity. Poverty and inequality stand in the way of economic growth for our state through higher social costs, lost earnings, and weakened competitiveness.
</p><p>I grew up in a working poor family, and in addition to the immorality of families working hard and barely scraping by, poverty is economically inefficient. Poverty comes at too high a cost—to families, to communities, and to our state as a whole. We need to harness the hard work and ingenuity of all our workers to advance our state. Moreover, we must support our future workforce by helping parents move out of poverty so their children can succeed in school, because we know poverty is the primary out-of-school impediment to learning and school performance.
</p><p>Georgians who struggle to get ahead rather than just get by face different challenges. Our campaign has already released bold and innovative platforms on jobs and child care, and we will continue to offer solutions to our toughest challenges in education, small business development, mental health care access, criminal justice, and other policy areas to address the many barriers to success. These initiatives are aimed at meeting Georgians where they are, and envisioning a state where success is not only possible, it is expected.
</p><p>To ensure all Georgians thrive, we must promote a fair economy that removes barriers to opportunity and fosters prosperity.  This platform addresses roadblocks for families facing low and stagnant wages, highest unemployment, and biggest skills gaps. These initiatives promote fairness in earnings and savings, learning opportunities, and employment options:
</p><p>Earn: Keep more money in the pocketbooks of working families through a Georgia Earned Income Tax Credit. Protect workers from wage theft to ensure wages earned are wages received. Secure equal pay for women through pay history reforms.
Save: Create a Cradle to Career Savings Program for families. Encourage savings and credit-building through the Georgia FinLit Initiative: A Financial Literacy and Wellness Partnership.
Grow: Bridge the skills gap with a focus on employability skills and adult literacy.
Include: Expand employment opportunities for Georgians with disabilities.
Protect: End workplace discrimination for all Georgians.

</p><p><b>Gun Safety</b><br />
Stacey Abrams is the only candidate for governor with a proven track record of voting against legislation that would put guns in the wrong hands, including opposing SB 350 in 2012, and opposing 2017’s NRA omnibus bill, HB 292. Read more about her plan to reduce gun violence in Georgia:
</p><p>Keep Guns Out of the Wrong Hands
</p><p>Support Survivors of Domestic Violence: Call for the immediate creation of a panel of victims, advocates, and lawmakers to determine the best way to ensure that perpetrators of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking aren’t able to access weapons. Such actions may include prohibiting possession and requiring the surrender of firearms or ammunition by domestic abusers. State laws addressing this “relinquishment gap” have lowered fire-arm related intimate partner homicides by 14%.[i] Additionally, we will support service providers to ensure victims in every part of the state have assistance and shelter when facing family violence. Georgia’s domestic violence service providers received more than 53,000 crisis calls in 2016. Shelters turned away more than 1,500 victims due to lack of bed space. The need is great, and we will work to close service gaps for victims.
</p><p>Require Universal Background Checks: Currently, Georgia does not require background checks for private gun sales between individuals (including at gun shows), creating a loophole through which individuals who would not pass background checks can still legally purchase firearms. The data confirms that policies such as universal background checks are effective in lowering suicide and murder rates.[ii]
</p><p>Allow Families to Petition for Extreme Risk Protection Orders: When a loved one has mental health challenges that put them at risk of endangering themselves or others, families and law enforcement should have a path to petition a court to temporarily restrict firearms access.
</p><p>Fix Our Broken Gun Laws
</p><p>Immediate Repeal of 2012’s SB 350: The AJC notes that this legislation “may be the most egregious gun law in Georgia” and “makes guns something close to sacred.” It requires guns used to commit crime be put back onto the street. It is opposed by members of law enforcement and encroaches on home rule.
</p><p>Immediate Repeal of 2017’s HB 280: “Campus Carry” legislation is opposed by Georgia university administrators, educators, and a majority of Georgians.
</p><p>Ensure People Receive the Help They Need
</p><p>Expand Medicaid: Medicaid expansion is critical to expanding mental health care access for Georgians. A report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last year found that people who accessed Medicaid were 30% more likely to receive mental health or substance abuse treatment. They estimated that 159,000 uninsured Georgians who are in the coverage gap suffer from mental illness or substance abuse challenges. Additional studies are finding that Medicaid expansion reduces crime rates due to this link between Medicaid and access to mental health and substance abuse treatment.
</p><p>Support Violence Prevention Efforts, Including Hospital Interventions, Community-Based Strategies, and Research. Hospital intervention programs provide mental health and substance abuse services, job placement, and conflict de-escalation training to interrupt violence. Initial evaluations of The Youth Intervention and Violence Intervention Program in Savannah hospitals show promising results. We will support hospital intervention programs that seek to disrupt cycles of violence. Additionally, we will support local governments and community-based organizations working directly with communities most affected by gun violence. Finally, we will continue the partnerships with academic researchers, such as Emory’s Violence Prevention Task Force, who seek to advance violence prevention through data driven solutions.
</p><p><b>Small Business</b><br />
9 Reasons Why Stacey Abrams Has the Vision &amp; Experience to Help Small Businesses Thrive
Stacey Abrams has a vision for Georgia: educate bold and ambitious children, build a fair and diverse economy, and lead an effective and engaged government. As an entrepreneur, Abrams understands to achieve this vision Georgia must create opportunities for small businesses to thrive in all 159 counties.
</p><p>Growing small businesses are central to a thriving economy in every county. Approximately 44% of Georgians in the private workforce are employed by a small business, and we are among the highest in the nation for startup success. However, Georgia ranks close to the bottom — 22 out of the 25 largest states — in Main Street Entrepreneurship, or the creation and success of businesses like barbershops, landscaping, manufacturing, and food service. Where you live continues to determine whether you succeed: places where our businesses and workers receive key supports get better, while struggling communities continue to decline.
</p><p>Rural business owners face twin challenges: how to find an educated workforce locally and how to access capital close to home. Business owners across the state face debilitating healthcare costs, which also reduce the productivity of the workforce. Women and people of color who have traditionally been left behind because of limited access to capital continue to lag, while others who have traditionally succeeded in small business ownership are beginning to fall behind.
</p><p>Georgia must support a diverse array of small businesses. From providing and capital for individuals who want to start a small childcare center in a county that lacks affordable options, to helping a barber open a second location or giving a young person in South Georgia the chance to start a technology company without having to leave her hometown, we can and must do more to help entrepreneurs grow and thrive in place.
</p><p>Stacey’s Vision to Support Small Businesses in Georgia:
</p><p>1. Stacey Abrams is uniquely qualified to lead on this issue. Under Stacey’s leadership, Georgia will pursue bold and comprehensive economic plans to ensure no person has to work more than one full-time job to make ends meet, and catalyze the creation of high wage jobs in all 159 counties, at all skill levels.
</p><p>2. To build a thriving and diverse economy, Abrams will expand access to capital, support training programs at every level of business, encourage expansion into non-­traditional industries and promote policies to expand entrepreneurial opportunities. Regardless of zip code, Georgia’s economic mission will be to help grow small businesses in rural, urban and suburban communities.
</p><p>3. Stacey Abrams is the only Georgia gubernatorial candidate to introduce a detailed jobs plan — her first in a series of economic revitalization proposals. Her “Advanced Energy Jobs Plan” will leverage our natural resources and assets, working across sectors to build 25,000 to 45,000 jobs in industries like solar, wind, hydro, and biomass. Small businesses like farms and installation companies in every part of our state, from Tybee Island and Camilla to North Georgia, already benefit from work in advanced energy and have spurred economic growth for small businesses in their communities.
</p><p>Stacey’s Experience as a Small Businesswoman, Entrepreneur &amp; Job Creator
</p><p>4. Stacey Abrams is an entrepreneur who has started several small businesses, and she understands what helps a company succeed. Early in her career, she learned first‐hand how access to capital can spur a small business and how the lack of funding can kill an entrepreneur’s dream.
</p><p>5. Stacey received an “A” rating from the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and the “Friend of Labor” award in the same year. She has been honored by the Georgia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the Atlanta Business Chronicle for her leadership.
</p><p>6. Stacey Abrams has started businesses that have succeeded and businesses that failed and she knows what makes the difference. When their manufacturing business could not secure a loan to automate — in order to meet a big order — Abrams and her business partner had to shutter their company. Then they co-founded NOW Corp., a fintech payment system that enables businesses to get paid immediately in a way that feels like taking a credit card, even when one is not offered. NOW Corp. has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to small businesses, helping them grow or retain thousands of jobs in Georgia.
</p><p>7. Abrams has spearheaded efforts that specialized in the development, investment and consulting for complex infrastructure projects, including transportation, energy, facilities and water. 
</p><p>8. Abrams has also co-­founded The Family Room, Inc., a social communications app that creates a virtual family room where young kids can talk, play, draw, read, do homework and watch videos with adults while on a video or audio call. The Family Room has support from organizations for military families, grandparents, divorced parents, families that may have a loved one who is incarcerated, and immigrant families separated by deportation.
</p><p>9. Abrams founded Third Sector Development and the New Georgia Project, a nonprofit that has hired thousands of Georgians and engaged them in civil rights work, including voter registration and signing families up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
</p><p><b>Voting Rights</b><br />
Stacey Abrams has a demonstrated commitment to protecting our right to vote. She founded the nonprofit New Georgia Project, which submitted more than 200,000 voter registration forms from predominantly communities of color between 2014 and 2016. The organization forced the restoration of more than 33,000 illegally canceled voter applications and defeated attempts to intimidate voters. As Minority Leader, Abrams fought back voter suppression tactics and introduced legislation to expand access to the ballot.
</p><p>As governor, Abrams will prioritize voting rights as essential to democracy and an effective government. She will leverage both administrative authority and advocate for legislation to accomplish the following:
</p><p>Georgia will make voter registration easy and convenient by:
Providing automatic voter registration when voters interact with state agencies, public colleges, universities, and technical colleges;
Exploring ways to allow online voter registration for everyone—not just those with drivers’ licenses or state IDs;
Supporting automatic registration;
Requiring voter registration applications be processed within 20 days of receipt;
Establishing same day voter registration; and
Mandating fair allocation of polling places and polling place resources during early voting and on Election Day.
</p><p>Georgia will make voting more accessible by:
Allowing sworn affidavits for voters who are unable to obtain a valid voter ID; and
Requiring convenience and stability in polling locations. Voters may cast their ballot at any precinct in their county for any election—not just during early voting periods. Precincts must be within 25 miles of every voter and cannot be changed within 90 days of an election. Early voting polling places must be distributed throughout each county.
</p><p>Georgia will ensure every vote counts by:
Using secure ballots, including, at a minimum, ensuring a paper trail for votes cast to increase accuracy, integrity, security, and confidence in our elections. Georgia is one of only a few states that does not provide a paper trail for voting. We will explore changes to our voting machine system to ensure there is a voter-verifiable paper audit trail for every vote cast; and
Prioritizing the allocation of funds to replace aging voting machines and to ensure security of all voting infrastructure, including voter registration systems.
</p><p>Georgia will stand up for democracy by:
Vetoing gerrymandered districts;
Supporting the creation of a nonpartisan redistricting commission to create fair districts; and
Protecting access to early voting and expanded weekend dates.

</p><p><b>Health</b><br />
9 Ways Stacey Abrams is a Champion for Health Care
Stacey Abrams has a vision for Georgia that includes educating bold and ambitious children, creating a fair and diverse economy, and building an effective and engaged government. A critical component of that vision is ensuring our workers and their families have access to quality, affordable health care, and expanding Medicaid will be her first step in achieving this goal.
</p><p>Stacey’s Record: Stacey Abrams has consistently engaged with Georgia’s rural, suburban and urban communities across the state to understand what Georgians are facing in an effort to improve their access to health care. Her experience and deep understanding of the role the private, nonprofit, and government sectors play in improving health care access make her the most qualified candidate to expand access to care for all Georgians.
</p><p>Legislative Leadership: As House Minority Leader, Stacey Abrams introduced legislation to expand Medicaid in our state, and led the House Democratic Caucus in a statewide campaign to raise awareness about the crucial nature of expansion for health care access, rural hospital support, and job creation. She mobilized Democrats to host town halls, engage with the media, provide local communities with toolkits, and ensured constituents in every part of the state were hearing from elected officials on the issue.
Legal Experience: Stacey Abrams began her career as a tax attorney and is an expert on health care finance. She understands the vital role that Medicaid expansion plays in supporting not just our rural hospitals, but our safety net hospitals that provide care for the vulnerable.
Leading on Reproductive Justice: Stacey Abrams has led the fight to protect reproductive health care access in Georgia. Abrams blocked legislation that attempted to roll back reproductive rights, successfully stopping a eugenics anti-abortion push. She also led the fight to substantially weaken a 20-week abortion ban and has supported legal opposition that has stymied the law’s implementation for 6 years. Under her leadership, no TRAP (Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers) legislation has passed Georgia, and she has been recognized as a Living Legend by Planned Parenthood of the Southeast, a recipient of the national Champion for Women’s Health Award from Planned Parenthood Action Fund and received local support from the Feminist Women’s Health Center. In 2014, she was awarded the first Gabrielle Giffords Rising Star Award and has been endorsed by EMILY’s List, and has been endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice America.
Addressing Maternal Health: More than half of Georgia counties do not have an OB-GYN provider, and our state has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation. This urgent problem demands leaders with real experience who can take swift action. Stacey Abrams understands a holistic approach to increase access to high quality care is needed to provide better outcomes for our mothers and babies. Funding rural hospitals via Medicaid expansion is a crucial first step in addressing this issue. Stacey will also leverage state and federal programs to incentivize more doctors and medical personnel to locate in under-served areas, and she will work with practitioners to reduce our maternal and infant mortality rates and increase access to care.
Supporting the Elderly: Stacey Abrams has worked to support health services for the elderly. As governor, she is committed to ensuring that expanding Medicaid would contribute to funding of assisted living centers, which would help elderly Georgians better afford housing and in home health care.
Protecting Workers: Stacey has spearheaded critical legislation combatting the misclassification of workers as independent contractors, which denies them access to health insurance through their employer.
Leading Activism: Stacey Abrams knows that the federal government and grassroots organizations play a key role in our state’s health care. Through Georgia Resists, a project she launched as House Minority Leader at the onset of the Trump Administration to push back against dangerous legislation at all levels of government, she galvanized activists around the state to engage with their legislators when Congress considered repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Championing the Affordable Care Act: When the Affordable Care Act was first implemented, Stacey Abrams saw that the state was not funding sufficient outreach during open enrollment. She led the members of the Georgia House Democratic Caucus to host their own open enrollment sessions, teaching their constituent members how to enroll. Stacey traveled to Republican-held districts to hold similar sessions. Her nonprofit New Georgia Project also hired canvassers in rural South Georgia communities to answer questions and help enroll Georgians.
Addressing Mental Health Services: Mental health care access is a critical component of health care that is too often overlook and unfunded. Stacey Abrams has personal experience navigating the effects of untreated mental illness in her family, and understands how critical access to mental health care services are for our state. Stacey’s family lacked health insurance when she was growing up, and her brother’s undiagnosed bipolar disorder led him to self-medicate with drugs, and eventually contributed towards his incarceration. Medicaid expansion will fund critical mental health services throughout Georgia and especially in rural, often-underserved communities so that individuals will have their needs addressed by the health care system rather than face the criminal justice system.

<p>A <a href="/State_legislative_scorecards" title="State legislative scorecards">scorecard</a> evaluates a legislator’s voting record. Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety.
</p><p>Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number.
